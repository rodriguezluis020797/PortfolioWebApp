      <p class="card-text">
        This website consists of 2 parts: A .NET 5.x server and AngularJS user interface (UI) that communicate through enabling
        Cross-Origin Requests. As of this moment it is still being developed, but it already contains features such as
        user profile creation/updating, and browser cookie services. An E-Mail SDK has also been implemented to be able to send temporary
        passwords to new users and current users that wish to reset their passwords if it has been lost.<br>
        <strong>Note: Overall layout of the UI is not yet finished and therefore may not be user friendly across all screen sizes.</strong>
